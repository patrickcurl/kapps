      # Search for parameters dynamically. The `findFiles` function takes a list of
      # file name patterns and a starting directory to search from. It then recursively
      # searches for a single file matching the pattern. If one (and only one) is found,
      # it's returned in the result array. Patterns that don't match any files are
      # filtered out.
      #
      # The `.sugarkube.defaultVars` variable is a list populated at runtime containing (in
      # order of precedence: provider, account, profile, cluster, region.
      #
      # So this horrific looking value searches for a file called 'values.yaml' under the kapp
      # cache directory, then files called `values-<provider/account/profile/etc>.yaml`. It takes
      # all files that exists and prepend '-f' to them to be passed as options to helm.
