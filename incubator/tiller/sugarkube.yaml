# This file is a golang template. Variable values come from the final set of
# variables applicable to the stack/profile/cluster/etc that you install this
# kapp into.

# since this isn't a Helm-based kapp, we have to track the version somewhere
# other than a `Chart.yaml` file. This lets us automatically tag our kapp repo
# in our CD pipeline.
version: 0.1.0

# Env vars to pass to this kapp. Values can come from variables.
